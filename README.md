Family Stock management
# Initial Prompt
I have a friend and he is a hunter. He hunts and sells the parts of meat he gets from the hinted animal. He is creating the product as meat and his wife takes care of the sales. but they are having problems coordinating if any of the meat (sausages, leg, back...) is reserved or sold or not. So they need a software on mobile. I want to learn java and flutter so i wish to enable them to achieve the coordination by software.

i want to have a java webapp as backend with postgres sql and on the front end a flutter application. which will run initially on androids. 

the backend should be like this.

the user logs in for the first time then backend should create a new environment (I will explain what i mean with environment) and the user should be the admin, the hunter should be the maintainer and any friend and/or family member who wants to help them should be viewer. The admin and maintainer should be able to share access as viewer to anyone with a simple code. the admin should be able to share access to also as maintainer. if a user in login does not want to create a new environment he/she should have a change to enter the code(can also be a url or even a qr code shared by admin) and then be able to access the environment. 

An environment in this context is the place where the produkt data is stored and managed by the admin and maintainer, so when a new user wants to create a new environment he/she has no access or any rights on another environment.

I have no idea from software development so instead of giving me the code first give me a mindset, what to think how to think, i will be able to work only 1 hour per day for this project so using claude i should be able to continue from where i left. please also teach me how i can work with claude like this.

1. [Developer Mindset](docs/developer-mindset.md)
2. [Working with Claude](docs/working-with-claude.md)

4. [Key Concepts](docs/concepts.md)

## Starting Questions for Tomorrow

When you start your first session, ask Claude:
1. "Help me set up a basic Spring Boot project with PostgreSQL"
2. "What's the minimal database schema I need for users and environments?"
3. "Show me how to create a simple login endpoint"

Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing syntax. The goal isn't to write perfect code - it's to build something that works and learn along the way.
