# Key Concepts

## Environment
Think of it like a private workspace. Each hunter couple gets their own "room" where they manage their products. Other environments can't see or access their data.

## Roles
- Admin: Full control (your friend's wife - handles sales)
- Maintainer: Can add/edit products (your friend - the hunter)
- Viewer: Can only see products (family/friends helping with sales)

## Access Control
Like giving out keys to your house - admins can give out "viewer keys" to anyone, but only admins can give out "maintainer keys"

## Technologies You'll Learn
- *Java Spring Boot*: Handles web requests, business logic, and database operations
- *PostgreSQL*: Stores all your data (users, products, environments)
- *Flutter*: Creates the mobile app that talks to your Java backend
- *REST APIs*: How your Flutter app and Java backend communicate
