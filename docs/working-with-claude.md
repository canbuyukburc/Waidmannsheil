# Working with Claude Effectively

## Session Structure (1 hour/day):
1. *5 minutes*: Tell Claude what you built yesterday and what you're stuck on
2. *45 minutes*: Code/implement with Claude's help
3. *10 minutes*: Document what you accomplished and what's next

## Key Phrases to Use:
- "I'm continuing from yesterday. Here's what I have so far..."
- "I have 1 hour today. What should I prioritize?"
- "Break this down into smaller steps I can complete in 45 minutes"
- "I'm getting this error... help me debug step by step"

*Save Context*: Always end each session by asking Claude to summarize what you built and what the next logical step is.
