# The Developer Mindset

*Think in Layers*: Your system has three main layers:
- *Data Layer* (PostgreSQL): Where information lives
- *Business Layer* (Java backend): Where rules and logic happen
- *Presentation Layer* (Flutter app): What users see and touch

*Start Small, Build Up*: Don't try to build everything at once. Think of it like building a house - foundation first, then walls, then roof. Your "foundation" is basic user authentication and environment creation.

*Problem-First Thinking*: Always ask "What problem am I solving right now?" before writing code. For example: "Users need to log in" → "I need authentication" → "I need to store user credentials securely"
