I've created three files:

Role.java: An enum defining the three user roles (ADMIN, MAINTAINER, VIEWER)

Environment.java: The environment entity with:

Unique name
Access codes for viewers and maintainers
Link to its users
Creation timestamp
User.java: The user entity with:

Basic info (first name, last name, email)
Password (will be encrypted)
Role (ADMIN, MAINTAINER, or VIEWER)
Link to their environment
Helper methods to check permissions
Creation timestamp and enabled status
The entities use:

@Entity: Marks the class as a JPA entity (database table)
@Data: Lombok annotation to generate getters, setters, toString, etc.
@ManyToOne/@OneToMany: Defines relationships between entities
@Column: Defines column properties like uniqueness and null constraints
@PrePersist: Automatically sets creation timestamp
These entities will create the following database tables:

environments: Stores all hunter family workspaces
users: Stores all user accounts with their roles and environment links
Would you like me to create the repositories for these entities next? Repositories will allow us to perform database operations (create, read, update, delete) on these entities.

# Explanation 
This code creates a blueprint for storing user information in a database. Think of it like a digital form that describes what information you keep about each user.
What it stores about each user:
Basic Info:

id - A unique number for each user (like a customer ID)
firstName and lastName - Person's name (both required)
email - Email address (must be unique, no duplicates allowed)
password - Login password (stored encrypted for security)

Permission Level:

role - What type of user they are (ADMIN, MAINTAINER, or VIEWER from your previous code)

Organization:

environment - Which company/group they belong to (one user belongs to one environment)

Account Status:

createdAt - When the account was created (automatically filled in)
enabled - Whether the account is active (true) or disabled (false)

Special Features:
Automatic timestamp: When a new user is created, it automatically records the current date/time.
Helper methods: Two shortcuts to check permissions:

isAdmin() - Returns true if user is an ADMIN
isMaintainer() - Returns true if user is MAINTAINER or ADMIN (admins can do everything maintainers can do)

Real-world example:
